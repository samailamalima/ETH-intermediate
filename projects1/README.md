## ErrorHandling Smart Contract Project
### Overview

The `ErrorHandling` smart contract is a simple Solidity contract that demonstrates different ways of handling errors and exceptional conditions within a contract. It includes functions for depositing and withdrawing funds, as well as a function for dividing two numbers. Additionally, the contract showcases the usage of `require`, `assert`, and `revert` statements for error handling.

### License

This contract is licensed under the MIT License, as indicated by the SPDX-License-Identifier specified at the beginning of the code.

### Solidity Version

The contract is written for Solidity version 0.8.9 or any compatible higher version.

### State Variables

- `balance`: An unsigned integer that stores the current balance of the contract. The `public` keyword allows external read access to this variable.

### Functions

#### 1. `depositRequire(uint _amount) public`

This function allows users to deposit funds into the contract. It requires the deposited amount to be greater than zero. If the requirement is not met, the transaction will be reverted with the specified error message.

##### Parameters

- `_amount`: The amount of funds to be deposited.

#### 2. `withdrawRequire(uint _amount) public`

This function allows users to withdraw funds from the contract. It requires the withdrawal amount to be greater than zero and not exceed the contract's balance. If any of these requirements are not met, the transaction will be reverted with the appropriate error message.

##### Parameters

- `_amount`: The amount of funds to be withdrawn.

#### 3. `divideRequire(uint _numerator, uint _denominator) public pure returns (uint)`

This pure function performs division of two numbers and returns the result. It requires the denominator to be non-zero; otherwise, the transaction will be reverted with the specified error message.

##### Parameters

- `_numerator`: The dividend.
- `_denominator`: The divisor.

##### Returns

- `uint`: The result of the division.

#### 4. `assertFunction() public pure`

This function demonstrates the use of the `assert` statement. It calls the `divideRequire` function with inputs that trigger a division by zero error. After that, it attempts to assert that the result of the division is equal to 6. However, this assertion will always fail since the division by zero would have already reverted the transaction.

> Note: The `assert` statement should not be used for regular error handling in production code. It is primarily intended for internal logic sanity checks.

#### 5. `revertFunction() public pure`

This function demonstrates the use of the `revert` statement. It calls the `divideRequire` function with inputs that produce a result of 5. If the result is equal to 5, the function will revert the transaction with a custom error message.

> Note: The `revert` statement should be used carefully and with caution in production code, as it completely reverts the current transaction, including any state changes made up to that point.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```


### Usage and Recommendations

1. Ensure the contract is deployed on a compatible Ethereum network that supports the Solidity version specified.

2. For the deposit and withdrawal functions, users should be aware of the contract's current balance and make sure they deposit or withdraw reasonable amounts.

3. The `divideRequire` function should be used with valid inputs to avoid division by zero errors.

4. The `assert` statement should not be used for regular error handling. Instead, use `require` and `revert` for explicit error checking and handling.

5. The `assertFunction` and `revertFunction` are meant for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in actual production code.

6. Make sure to review and test the contract thoroughly before deploying it to the mainnet or any critical environment.
